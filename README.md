## Features

- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Clean and modern UI design powered by Tailwind CSS.
- **Supports both light and dark mode with easy switching for optimal viewing experience.**
- Interactive data visualization using Recharts (e.g., line charts, bar charts, pie charts).
- Example components for common admin dashboard elements (e.g., navigation, cards, tables, forms).
- Potentially includes state management (e.g., using Context API, Redux, or Zustand) for theme and other application states.
- Possibly includes routing (e.g., using React Router) for navigation between different dashboard sections.
- Any other specific functionalities you've implemented.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and theming.
- **Recharts:** A composable charting library built on React components for creating beautiful and interactive charts.
- **[Other Dependencies]:** List any other significant libraries or dependencies you've used (e.g., React Router, state management libraries like Redux Toolkit or Zustand, date/time libraries like Day.js or Moment.js, etc.).
- **[Development Tools]:** Mention any key development tools (e.g., Node.js, npm or yarn).

## Installation

Get started by cloning the repository and installing the necessary dependencies.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Gogo602/Sidebar.git](https://github.com/Gogo602/Sidebar.git)
    cd Sidebar
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    This will typically launch the dashboard in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Navigate through the dashboard using the sidebar menu. You'll find various sections showcasing different data and functionalities.

- Explore the responsive design by resizing your browser window.
- **Look for a theme toggle (likely an icon or switch in the navigation or header) to switch between the light and dark color schemes. The dashboard will update its appearance instantly.**
- Interact with the charts and other components to understand the data presented.

## Customization

Personalize the dashboard to fit your specific needs:

- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS's utility classes provide a flexible way to style components. Modify existing classes or add new ones directly in your React components. The theme (light/dark mode) is likely managed through Tailwind's `dark:` variant or custom CSS based on a theme context.
- **Components:** Create new reusable UI elements in the `src/components` directory and import them into your pages or other components. Ensure new components are styled to work well in both light and dark modes.
- **Pages/Views:** Add or modify dashboard sections by creating or editing files in the `src/pages` directory. Define the layout and content for each page.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilize Recharts' extensive set of chart components to visualize your data. Refer to the Recharts documentation for customization options. Consider how chart colors adapt to the active theme for better visual consistency.
- **Theme Customization:** If you have a specific theme implementation, explore the relevant files (e.g., in `contexts/ThemeContext.js` or custom CSS files) to understand how to modify the color palettes for light and dark modes. You might be able to adjust primary, secondary, and accent colors.
